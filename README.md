Assignment 2 of Applied Data Science 1.

• Ingest and manipulate the data using pandas dataframes. Your program should include a function which takes a filename as argument, reads a dataframe in World-bank format and returns two dataframes: one with years as columns and one with countries as columns.

• Explore the statistical properties of a few indicators, that are of interest to you, and cross-compare between individual countries and/or the whole world and produce appropriate summary statistics. You can also use aggregated data for regions and other categories. You are expected to use the .describe() method to explore your data and two other statistical methods.

• Explore and understand any correlations (or lack of) between indicators . Does this vary between country, have any correlations or trends changed with time?

• You are expected to use your initiative and “tell a story” with the data. You should use appropriate visualisation and provide a text narrative to communicate and explain your findings. Details of the implementation and the coding do not belong in such a report. Your boss wants to see results and interpretation. What are the key findings?
